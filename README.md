GIT TAGGING
I'm not sure how I was supposed to tag, but I tagged everything as follows: 0.X.Y
- X represents the milestone (just like in the instructed)
- Y represents the iteration of the milestone (I kinda found that you cannot use the same tag
  across commits, which means that I'm not able to update, so I used the Y to represent which
  version of that milestone I'm on. I'm not sure if this is what Ajarn instructed me to do, though.)

THINGS I WISH I DID BEFORE COMMITTING
- For milestone 1, there is a bug where if you don't put in anything (empty command), it would only work normally only if there was no command before it.
  - This means that it isn't going to work properly if you just put in empty commands after you've already used a command.
