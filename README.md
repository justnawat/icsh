*** GIT TAGGING ***
I'm not sure how I was supposed to tag, but I tagged everything as follows.
** 0.X.Y **
- X represents the milestone (just like in the instructed)
- Y represents the iteration of the milestone (I kinda found that you cannot use the same tag
  across commits, which means that I'm not able to update, so I used the Y to represent which
  version of that milestone I'm on. I'm not sure if this is what Ajarn instructed me to do, though.)
